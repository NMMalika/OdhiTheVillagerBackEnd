                        <p>This song may go down in history as one of the last songs the legendary Tedd Josiah recorded
                            for public consumption. However, for reasons, beyond human control, but which I wouldn't
                            like to go into here, he was unable to complete the project, so the final bits were tied up
                            elsewhere.
                            A few years ago, I was introduced to Tedd by Titi Solomon, who had in turn Ben introduced to
                            me buy my friend Makadem, who both felt that Tedd would bring out an angle from my music
                            which had not come out in my earlier recordings. We had initially only planned for 1 song,
                            but within 5 days, we'd agreed to do 2 songs, one of which (Jawar Nitie), has already been
                            shared in both YouTube and Facebook "Odhi the Villager" pages. In the course of our studio
                            engagements, I informed Tedd that at home in Homa Bay I had regular gigs with the living
                            legend, him of Benga history, Samuel Akech Jabuya, aka Akech Oyosi - the man who at around
                            age 20 years actually imagined and founded the then revolutionary Benga sound (now
                            world-renowned) in early 1960s, while a member of Ogara Boys Band. Tedd was very excited,
                            and asked me to bring along Oyosi at the earliest opportunity.
                            When Akech came, he was adamant that he would not record (or even play) Benga, stating that,
                            as a creative artist, he no longer found any excitement in the genre. He had carried along a
                            self-made xylophone, on which he had creating new sounds. So as a compromise with Tedd, he
                            only agreed to do a remix of one of his older songs before recording his xylophone song. .

                    <div class="blog__details__quote">
                        <p>Meanwhile, I had also come along with my long time Duol companion, master orutu player
                            Kenneth Oguda JaMariri, with the intention of spicing one of my songs. Oguda and I come a
                            long way, and have a load of songs composed - only a few released so far. At one point
                            during the recording, Akech excused himself to have a short puff (as a doctor I've had a
                            futile prolonged struggle to have him even just reduce on his tobacco consumption!). Tedd
                            also went to warm for us some drinking water (we like sipping that a lot when recording), as
                            Oguda and I rehearsed an old mournful orutu tune we loved to do during interludes. When Tedd
                            came back, he asked me to call Akech back in. I playfully called out his name loudly. He
                            didn't respond! I called out louder. Still silent. The third time I was much louder, but
                            mockingly made it sound like the way mothers call out a child in the village. He then
                            mumbled some incoherent response, which made all of us burst out laughing.
                            Tedd excitedly noted: "That sounds very interesting", and suggested that instead of adding
                            the orutu skit to the previous songs I'd done, we use it to create a new song, with that
                            playful call (and response) as a nidus. So as Oguda continued playing the mournful orutu
                            skit, I immediately created a simple 2-chord backing rhythm. Tedd quietly muttered:
                            "Perfect!", hooked the orutu to a mike, and the basic first 3 tracks of a new song were
                            made. He released us, till the next day, to work further on the song, especially the lyrics!
                        </p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="blog__details__desc">
                        <p>The following day, I only had a few lines of lyrics, but I suggested the theme name "Ichanda"
                            ("You are disturbing me"), from the skeleton I was creating. Meanwhile, Tedd completed
                            Oyosi's songs and gave us a break a 3-week break.
                            I felt that "persecution" (sand) and "ill-will" would create a more powerful theme than
                            "disturbance" (chand) or thak (frustration). I was especially focused on the evil meted by
                            people who are paradoxically considered "good" by society - people with power and authority,
                            and the ability to hide their "badness", as they publicise their goodness, yet, under this
                            cover, are terribly evil. I thought of the worldwide ubiquitous story of the generous woman
                            and the "thankless" hunchback/beggar (etc) whose only response to any assistance the woman
                            gave was (in the Dholuo version): "Itimo marach itimo ne in! Itimo maber itimo ne in" ("The
                            evil you do, you do to yourself! The good you do, you do to yourself"). The Hindu version,
                            adopted by English speakers go: "‚ÄúThe evil you do, remains with you: The good you do, comes
                            back to you!‚Äù You probably know others with slight variations.
                            .</p>
                        <p>When we came back 3 weeks later, I had officially changed the title to "Isanda" (You are
                            persecuting me"). We all agreed to make the song short and very simple! A keyboard solo
                            track was recorded (but we all agreed it was weak). (Much later, I discarded it, preferring
                            a lower-octave orutu instead).
                            The songs were thereafter in limbo for a number of years, as I tried to look for a
                            production engineer who would complete them, with the same original spirit intact. I head
                            intended to release it late last year, but for some reasons, my spirit refused! It has now
                            agreed!üòÄ</p>
